* **Amend:** If you miss some file in last commit, then use  --amend switch.  Add the missed files to stage, then  commit with amend switch.   This will add the file to previous commit. 
```
git commit --amend
```
* Donot commit half-work to main branch.  For development activities, always create seperate branch and commit often in the branch. Once testing is done, commit to main branch. 
* Donot use Amend in published work (already pushed to server).  Doing so, the further commit push will be rejected by server.  Pulling from server to update local copy will result in merge conflict. 
* Some thing got messed up after last commit?  If you **don't** want  the changes, then use `git reset --hard `.   If you want the changes to store some where else for a while, use  `git stash`.  `git stash pop` will bring those changes afterwards.
* Have plugins for your editior/IDE to do code format automatically. This will reduces the unnecessary changes in files due to code formatting in later point of time.
* `git log` show the log messages.  `git log --oneline` will show the log messages with hash and commit message.  To  exit log terminal, hit <kbd>q</kbd> and `enter`.
