[Forest App](http://www.forestapp.cc/) - App home page.

Instead of, we using the smart phones, we are being used by smart phone applications.  Its time to wake up from this addiction and keep our phones aside and do some things that matters.  Let it be being more productive in office, studying or spending time with friends.  

If you want to get out of phone addiction or want to manage your time in innovative way, then Forest app is for you.  Basically, it is simple app based on [Pomodoro technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).  But the motivation factor introduced in this app is some what innovative.  

Whenever you like focus, you need to plant a tree.  The tree will start growing.  If you leave the app to check facebook or messages, you tree will be killed.  If the app is undisturbed for another 30 minutes, the tree will grow fully and gets add to your forest.  The more trees you have in the forest shows you focused more on your work.  Dead trees intimate you need more discipline over time management.  This inspires me more postively than other plain pomodoro application.
